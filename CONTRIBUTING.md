# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `[PACKAGE](LINK) - DESCRIPTION.`
- New categories, or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Keep descriptions **short** and **simple**, but **descriptive**.
- End descriptions with a period.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Maintain consistent and correct naming (ex: `reMarkable`, not `remarkable` or `ReMarkable`) on descriptions. This doesn't apply to repo/project names.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- Order your suggestions alphabetically.

Thank you for your suggestions!
